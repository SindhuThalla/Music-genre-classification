# Music-genre-classification
This was done as a part of my group project.
We developed a new approach for retrieving musicalÂ features from audio music using 
a convolutional neural network (CNN), a technique widely used in image retrieval tasks, to address this problem. 
Our tests demonstrate that CNN has a high potential for capturing detailed features from musical pattern variants with no prior knowledge.
